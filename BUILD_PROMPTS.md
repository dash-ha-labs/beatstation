# BUILD_PROMPTS.md — Krisp

## PURPOSE

Ordered prompts the humans paste into Claude Code to build Krisp. Each prompt maps to tasks in `docs/TASKS.md`. Send the next prompt only after the agent reports the previous checkpoint.

## CONTEXT

- Source of truth: `CLAUDE.md` and `docs/`. Doc rules: `AGENT.md`.
- Two Claude Code sessions can run in parallel (Person A / Person B) after Prompt 0. `git pull` before each prompt; commit at the end of each.
- Human-only steps are in `docs/SETUP.md`.

## PROMPT 0 — Repository, Entire, scaffold (both, T0)

```text
Read CLAUDE.md, AGENT.md and every file in docs/ before doing anything.

1. Repository source: follow CLAUDE.md → REPOSITORY SOURCE exactly. The user gave /et/krisp/krisp. If it exists locally, set up the entire repo there as the project root. If not, STOP and ask me for the full clone URL — do not guess. Check git history and warn me if there are commits before 2026-10-02T02:00:00Z or non-trivial existing code.
2. Make sure CLAUDE.md, AGENT.md, BUILD_PROMPTS.md and docs/ are in the project root. Delete any old POCKET_SPEC.md.
3. Entire: set up Entire for this repo per docs/SETUP.md §1 using only commands verified in https://docs.entire.io. If you cannot verify them, give me the exact manual steps instead.
4. Scaffold per docs/TRD.md → STACK and REPOSITORY LAYOUT (Vite, React 18, TS, Tailwind, zustand, tone, @tonejs/midi, @magenta/music, @huggingface/transformers, pg, vitest). Add .env.example, .gitignore, scripts/check-secrets.sh, src/theme/tokens.css from docs/UI_DESIGN.md, fonts.
5. Home placeholder renders a Panel with "KRISP".
Report status of each step. Commit "chore(T0): scaffold".
