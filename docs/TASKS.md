# TASKS.md — Krisp

## PURPOSE

Ordered build tasks with owner, dependencies, timebox, and acceptance check. Agents work in dependency order and update STATUS.
What to build: `docs/TRD.md`. Acceptance IDs (AC-*): `docs/MVP.md`. Prompts to start each task: `BUILD_PROMPTS.md`.

## CONTEXT

- Person A: data, backend, sounds, AI, export pipeline. Person B: UI primitives, Beat Editor, Song, Mixer UI, polish.
- Times are relative to the team's start (H+0). Absolute limits: code freeze **2026-10-04T23:00:00Z**; post published by **2026-10-05T06:30:00Z** (deadline 06:59).
- Timeboxes are maximums. Over the box → apply `docs/MVP.md` → CUT-LINE.

## CHECKPOINTS

| ID | Target | Condition |
|---|---|---|
| CP0 | H+1 | Repo, Entire, scaffold running; Tiger schema applied |
| CP1 | H+2 | Magenta smoke test passes (or UMD fallback) |
| CP2 | H+6 | Hand-made Beat plays with swing through the mixer graph |
| CP3 | H+10 | Workspaces save/load; Song plays 3 Beats in order |
| CP4 | H+15 | Create/Upload/Library/Search work; audio lanes play loops |
| CP5 | H+18 | Mixer drawer + Humanize + Variations + WAV export work |
| CP6 | H+20 / code freeze | Deployed; all MUST acceptance criteria pass on live URL |
| CP7 | before 2026-10-05T06:30:00Z | Handover filmed, post published |

| T18 | B | Friend feedback 2026-10-04: Volume knobs on Rack rows, AUDIO lane headers and Transport (Master); every Knob turns by rotary drag; default value at 12 o'clock (right = more, left = less); Song scrollbar hidden | T9 | 1.5 h | `tests/knob.test.ts`; knob turn moves the Mixer Fader to the same dB | DONE |
| T21 | both | Full QA pass 2026-10-04 (headless Chrome, writes faked in-memory): every control and feature F1–F10 exercised; fixes: duplicate menu keys, ambiguous preset preview labels, LED dots over labels, square choice chips, clipped Create textarea, chip-row / grid scrollbars | T20 | 2 h | All F1–F10 checks pass; no console errors; no overflow at 1440/1050/390 px | DONE |

| T19 | A | Friend feedback 2026-10-04: loops glitch and a full grid lags. Strip-input cycle-check barrier, baked MetalSynth hats, sample polyphony cap, skip unchanged mixer params, path-based clip mini maps, audio warm-up on first gesture | T4, T9 | 2 h | `tests/perf.test.ts`; full grid at 4× CPU throttle loops with 0 late ticks (TRD → PERFORMANCE) | DONE |

## PARALLELISM

- After T0: A runs T0b → T1 → T3 → T4; B runs T2.
- B starts T5 once T2 and T3 land; A runs T6 meanwhile.
- T7 (B) and T8 (A) run in parallel; T9 (B) and T10 (A) next; T11 (B) last before deploy.
- Start the post draft (T17 skeleton) during T13–T15 waits.
